# ADB-Tools
A bundle of functions to invoke adb commands

ADB is a headache to use manually, so I've automated some of it. Everything in the repo is for the automation of specific tasks, like enabling MTP on a phone which doesn't have default usb behavior settings or automatically connecting over tcp(when usb is plugged in) for easier debugging.
### Capabilities:

* Reconnect to device over TCP
* Enable MTP
